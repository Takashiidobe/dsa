# DSA

Some implementations of data structures and algorithms in Rust.
Currently using a fork of
[`pycco`](https://github.com/Takashiidobe/pycco) with support for rust.

This setup comes from
[`rust-101`](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html)

To create the docs, run `./iter.sh` which generates all the docs.

This repo also uses the nightly compiler for access to the internal rust
bencher.
